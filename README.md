## Movie Genre Classification

### Project Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. The primary focus is on textual data analysis and classification.

### Dataset
- **Source**: A dataset containing movie plot summaries and their associated genres (e.g., IMDB dataset or other similar sources).
- **Structure**:
  - `plot_summary`: Textual description of the movie.
  - `genre`: The genre label(s).

### Techniques and Models
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Tokenization, Lemmatization, Stopword Removal.
  - Feature extraction using **TF-IDF** or **Word Embeddings** (e.g., Word2Vec or GloVe).
- **Algorithms**:
  - Naive Bayes
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)

### Steps to Run
1. Preprocess the data and extract features.
2. Train the model using the selected classifier.
3. Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. Use the trained model to predict genres for new plot summaries.

## Credit Card Fraud Detection

### Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques.

### Dataset
- **Source**: A dataset containing anonymized credit card transaction details.
- **Structure**:
  - Features like transaction amount, time, and other encoded attributes.
  - `Class`: Indicates whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0).

### Techniques and Models
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Handling imbalanced data using techniques like **SMOTE** or undersampling.
  - Scaling features using **StandardScaler** or **MinMaxScaler**.
- **Algorithms**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forests

### Steps to Run
1. Preprocess the data and handle class imbalance.
2. Train the model with the chosen algorithm.
3. Evaluate using metrics like AUC-ROC, precision-recall, and confusion matrix.
4. Use the trained model to classify new transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

## Customer Churn Prediction

### Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service using historical customer data.

### Dataset
- **Source**: A dataset containing customer demographics and usage behavior.
- **Structure**:
  - Features like usage patterns, subscription type, and demographics.
  - `Churn`: Indicates whether a customer has churned (1) or remained (0).

### Techniques and Models
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Handle missing values and encode categorical variables (e.g., One-Hot Encoding).
  - Normalize or standardize numerical features.
- **Algorithms**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forests
  - Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)

### Steps to Run
1. Preprocess and engineer features.
2. Train the model using the selected classifier.
3. Evaluate using metrics like accuracy, precision-recall, and AUC-ROC.
4. Use the trained model to predict customer churn.

## Spam SMS Detection

### Project Overview
This project involves building an AI model to classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate.

### Dataset
- **Source**: A dataset of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham (legitimate).
- **Structure**:
  - `message`: The SMS text.
  - `label`: Indicates whether the message is spam or ham.

### Techniques and Models
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Text cleaning (removing punctuation, converting to lowercase).
  - Feature extraction using **TF-IDF** or **Word Embeddings**.
- **Algorithms**:
  - Naive Bayes
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)

### Steps to Run
1. Preprocess and extract features from the SMS messages.
2. Train the model using the chosen classifier.
3. Evaluate using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. Use the trained model to classify new SMS messages as spam or legitimate.
